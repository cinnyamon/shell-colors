## Little script i found that shows shell colors.

To use, download the file, move it somewhere like ```/home``` or ```/usr/local/bin``` (add ```/usr/local/bin``` to your $PATH using: ```PATH=$PATH:~/usr/local/bin``` if you move it here) then modify your shell flavour of choice (.bashrc .zshrc etc.) and add the line ```sh colors.sh``` at the end or anywhere unobstructing. Save, exit the terminal, and open a new one to see it.
